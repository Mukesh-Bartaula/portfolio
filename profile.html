            Hello, I'm Mukesh Bartaula, and I'm currently studying Computer Applications at Hetauda School of
            Management. I started my education at Siddhartha Shishu Sadan in Hetauda and finished my SEE in 2017. After
            that, I focused on science at Hetauda School of Management from 2017 to 2019. During my studies, I've been
            learning about HTML/CSS, PHP, Python, Django, and Git, which are all about making websites and apps.<br>

            Even though I haven't worked much yet, I'm really passionate about web development and programming. I've
            been involved in school projects to practice what I've learned. I can speak both English and Nepali, making
            it easy for me to communicate with others.<br>

            I'm excited to learn more and take on new challenges in the tech world as I continue my BCA studies. Check
            out my portfolio to see what I've been working on. I'm looking forward to opportunities to grow and make a
            positive impact in the field of web development.<br>
